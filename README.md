Power BI DAX Illustration Project - README

Overview:
This Power BI project is dedicated to showcasing Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) functionality through practical examples using provided datasets. The project focuses on demonstrating various DAX functions and calculations to derive insights from the data.

Datasets:

Data 1: Contains product details such as product ID, product name, price, and production cost.
Data 2: Provides information about customer orders, including customer name, product ID, order ID, units sold, and date purchased.
Purpose:
The purpose of this Power BI project is to illustrate the usage of DAX functions for performing calculations, creating custom metrics, and generating insights from the data. By utilizing DAX, users can perform complex calculations, create calculated columns and measures, and analyze data dynamically within Power BI.

Key Features:

Implementation of basic arithmetic calculations (e.g., revenue, profit).
Utilization of DAX functions for aggregation and filtering.
Creation of calculated columns to enrich the dataset.
